<p>Free Code Camp project - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-the-game-of-life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a>. Recreated mathematician John Conway's cellular automation "game" using React. I'm still not sure why this is considered a "zero-player game" and not just a "model"...</p>
